##Contact Info

A simple open source contact database built on the cayley graph database and the Go (golang) programming language.

###How it works:
you create an account, fill in your normal details;
like your name, your email, phone number, social media accounts etc.
Just information you want in anybody's phone book.

At a conference or somewhere, you meet a person who gets your name, but
forgets to get your contact. All he has to do is go to the google, an upcoming mobile app,
or the website, then search for the Name, Phone number, or any other detail he has,
Then download your contact, either as a VCard or QR code.

Or if he has the upcoming mobile app, all he'd have to do is add you as a contact.
The benefit is that people get to have you saved on their devices just the way you want.
The same contact image you uploaded yourself, not a random picture of you they found on their phone.
The contacts are even saved with your real name, which you typed into your account yourself.\
Not that nickname they have of you, which you've always dreaded.


###Please note that this work is still in its coding stage, meaning most features are still being implemented
